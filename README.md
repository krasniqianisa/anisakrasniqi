In this repository, we can find a bunch of very useful queries to exploit various issues in our mysql databases. Most of the queries use the performance_schema, so we should be sure that the variable is set to ON. 

Mainly, the queries work for mysql server 5.6 and superior server versions.

The collection of scripts can be handy and can helpful for DBAs and developers in order to have better insight of the systems. 

Feel free to comment, raise issues in case of perplexities
